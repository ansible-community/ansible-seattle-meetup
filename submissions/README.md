# Submissions

If you'd like to present a talk, please submit a pull request and add your suggestion to this directory in .txt, .md or .rst format. You can see an example submission here.

This directory's submissions will be flushed periodically and moved over to the presentations for talks that have been done.

Otherwise, submissions might be kept for the next meetup !
